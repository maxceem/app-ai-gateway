/**
 * The tools the MCP server offers, as an explicit allowlist over the catalog.
 *
 * Every tool runs a catalog operation through the same executor the HTTP API
 * and the CLI run it through, or opens one of the engine's operations through
 * the same management functions the CLI's operations run through, so its
 * authorization is the operation's policy and its answer is the operation's.
 * What a tool adds is what an agent needs and an HTTP client does not: a
 * verb-first name, a description of when to reach for it, one input object in
 * place of a path and a query, and a sentence summarising the answer.
 *
 * The order is the design's and is deliberate: `tools/list` answers with it,
 * and a stable order is what lets a client cache the list.
 *
 * What a tool may change is checked twice. A tool's operation has the type
 * {@link ToolOperation}: an operation whose catalog policy needs no more than
 * the `read` grant, or one of the writes in {@link MCP_WRITE_OPERATIONS},
 * which is the design's list and nothing more. And the table refuses to build
 * if `operationPolicy` says a tool marked as reading writes, or a writing tool
 * names an operation that list does not — so a write cannot be added by naming
 * it. The creates and the changes whose secret a person enters in a browser are
 * not catalog operations: they open an operation of the engine's, and a tool
 * that does names its kind.
