App AI Gateway sits between a person's applications and AI providers such as
OpenAI, Anthropic and Gemini. The person stores a provider credential once,
and every app they create reaches providers through the gateway with its own
authentication, its own routing and its own limits on its users. This server
lets you read and, as it grows, manage all of that on the person's behalf.

## Who you are acting as

You connected with a credential that belongs to one account, and every tool
acts in that account only. What you may do is the credential's owner's role in
the account and the credential's grant together: a \`read\` credential lists,
inspects and validates, and nothing more. Call \`get_account\` first. It names
the account and the deployment, and says whether the account has a person as
its owner.

On a hosted deployment, an account nobody has claimed yet is temporary: its
free access ends thirty days after it was created, and the account is deleted
when its recovery deadline passes, unless a person claims it. When
\`get_account\` reports an unclaimed account, tell the person, and use \`claim_account\` to start the
claim: it returns a URL the person opens in their own browser. Never open that
URL yourself or act as the person approving it.

## Reading

- \`get_account\`, \`get_capabilities\` — the account, and what the deployment supports.
- \`list_models\` — the priced models an app may allow.
- \`list_providers\`, \`get_provider\`, \`list_provider_gateways\` — the provider
  credentials and provider gateways the account holds, as metadata.
- \`list_apps\`, \`get_app\` — the apps, and one app's whole stored document.
- \`validate_app\` — whether an app document would be accepted, without saving it.
- \`check_app\` — whether an app can serve requests, without sending one.
- \`get_app_snippet\` — the first request an app can send.
- \`list_app_keys\` — a server app's keys, as metadata.
- \`list_app_users\`, \`get_app_user\` — an app's end users.
- \`list_app_events\`, \`list_auth_events\`, \`get_auth_event_summary\`,
  \`list_rejection_events\` — what an app's traffic did, and why requests or
  sign-ins were refused.
- \`get_usage\`, \`get_usage_breakdown\`, \`get_usage_timeseries\` — usage and
  cost, for the account or one app.

Every app tool takes the app's id as \`app\`; \`list_apps\` returns them. Lists
of events are newest first and page backwards: pass the \`next_before_id\` of
one answer as \`before_id\` to the next call. Months are \`YYYY-MM\` and days
\`YYYY-MM-DD\`, in UTC.

## Changing things

Read before you write. List providers and apps first so you use slugs and ids
that exist, read an app with \`get_app\` before proposing a change to it, and
check the change with \`validate_app\` before making it. An app document is
\`{name, config, status?}\`, as \`get_app\` returns it without its id and
revision; the gateway assigns an app's id, which never changes, and an update carries the \`revision\` it was read at, so a document
someone changed since is refused rather than overwritten.

Changes come in three shapes.

**Creates take two calls.** \`add_app\` and \`add_app_key\` first reserve: called
without \`handle\`, they check the arguments, create nothing, and answer a
\`handle\` and the reserved operation's \`id\`. Call the same tool again with
the same arguments and that \`handle\`, within 15 minutes, to create it; the
\`id\` is what \`get_operation\` takes, never a handle. If the creating call's
answer is lost, call again with the same handle: it answers the same result
with \`replayed: true\` and creates nothing more. A handle sent with different
arguments is refused with \`operation_mismatch\`; one that lapsed with
\`operation_expired\`; reserve again in either case. When a reservation answers a \`notice\`, an identical
request was made in the last hour: inspect it with \`get_operation\` before you
create a second.

**Changes that need a secret complete in a browser.** \`add_provider\`,
\`add_provider_gateway\`, \`rotate_provider_key\` and
\`rotate_provider_gateway_key\` take everything but the key or token, and answer
a URL. Give it to the person: they open it, enter the secret there and
approve. Poll \`get_operation\` with the answer's \`id\` until it is
\`completed\`, or \`expired\` (with \`denied\` when they declined). Never open the
URL yourself.

**Everything else takes effect at once**: \`update_provider\`,
\`update_provider_gateway\` and \`update_app\` carry the revision you read, so a
change someone made since is refused rather than overwritten;
\`remove_provider\`, \`remove_provider_gateway\` and \`remove_app\` delete for
good and need the id again as \`confirm\`; \`revoke_app_key\`,
\`block_app_user\` and \`unblock_app_user\` act at once. Prefer reversible
changes: disable an app or a provider rather than deleting it unless the
person asked for the deletion.

\`get_operation\` reads any operation a change tool opened, by its id. It never
returns a secret.

## Secrets

No secret ever passes through a tool, in either direction. A provider
credential is typed by the person into a browser page, never given to you and
never accepted as a tool argument. A key \`add_app\` or \`add_app_key\` creates
is never in a tool result: the answer carries \`reveal_url\`, a page the person
opens signed in to the console as an owner or admin, where they see the key
once and copy it. Never ask the person to paste a secret into the
conversation, and never print one you come across.

How the server holds to that:

- **Credential names.** A field is named like a credential when its name,
  lower-cased and with \`_\` and \`-\` removed, is one of \`secret\`, \`token\`, \`apikey\`, \`password\`, \`passwd\`, \`passphrase\`, \`credential\`, \`credentials\`, \`authorization\`, \`accesstoken\`, \`refreshtoken\`, \`idtoken\`, \`authtoken\`, \`sessiontoken\`, \`bearertoken\`, \`clientsecret\`, \`apisecret\`, \`secretkey\` and \`privatekey\`. The whole name
  is compared: \`api_key\`, \`apiKey\` and \`Token\` match; \`secretHint\`,
  \`tokenHint\` and \`max_tokens\` do not.
- **Refused arguments.** Every tool that answers a URL for a browser step
  (\`add_provider\`, \`add_provider_gateway\`, \`rotate_provider_key\`,
  \`rotate_provider_gateway_key\`), and \`add_app\`, \`update_app\` and
  \`validate_app\` for the app document they take, refuse a call carrying a
  field with such a name anywhere in its arguments: at any depth, inside a
  list, beside the documented arguments or inside them. The refusal names the
  field, never its value, and nothing is stored.
- **URLs in a browser step.** Before a browser step is stored, every string in
  its arguments is trimmed; one longer than any field of a browser step accepts
  is refused at once, and the rest are read with the platform's URL parser, as
  a browser would read them. A \`baseUrl\` must pass the same rules the provider
  write applies: \`https://\` on a public domain name, no credentials, no query
  string or fragment, no port. Any other string the parser reads as a URL is
  refused when it carries credentials (\`https://user:pass@…\`, however it is
  written) or when its query or fragment names a credential: both are first
  percent-decoded, repeatedly, so an encoded delimiter delimits, then split on
  every \`?\`, \`&\`, \`#\` and \`;\`. A piece with an \`=\` is a parameter: its name is
  stripped of leading \`?\`, \`#\` and \`/\` and compared with the names above. A piece without one is a route or a flag and is not judged. So
  \`?api_key=…\`, \`#access_token=…\` and \`#/callback?token=…\` are refused, while
  \`https://example.com/?version=2\`, \`https://example.com/#/settings/password\`
  and a name like \`OpenAI: production\` are accepted.
- **Results.** In every tool result, a field with a credential name is shown
  as \`[redacted]\` — the whole field, whatever it holds: a string, a number, a
  list or an object — whatever stored it, since an app document written
  through the API may carry provider-native parameters of any name. The one
  exception is the metadata of the key a tool created, in the \`api_key\` of an
  \`add_app\` or \`add_app_key\` result and in \`result.api_key\` of a
  \`get_operation\` result (\`id\`, \`name\`, \`key_prefix\`, \`created_at\`), shown
  when it holds nothing else. An \`api_key\` anywhere else, inside an app
  document included, is redacted. A field holding \`null\` stays \`null\`, and
  hint fields such as \`secretHint\` are shown as they are. Do not send a
  \`[redacted]\` value back in an update; leave that field out or ask the
  person.

## Errors

A refusal is a tool result marked as an error, not a protocol failure. Its
text is \`<code>: <message>. <what to do next>\`, and its structured content is
\`{error, message, status, next}\`. The code is the gateway's own and stable:
\`app_not_found\` means the id is not one of the account's apps, \`invalid_request\`
means the arguments break a rule the message names, and \`grant_insufficient\`
means the credential may read but not change. \`next\` names the tool to call or
the browser step to take. An \`internal_error\` is the gateway's failure, not
yours; try again later.

## Rules

1. Never send a request through an app to test it unless the person asks:
   every one reaches a provider and costs them money. \`check_app\` and
   \`get_app_snippet\` send nothing.
2. Changes take up to a minute to reach live traffic.
3. Report what you did with ids and names, never with a credential.
